      <p>Nage and Uke sit opposite each other in <term keyref="glossary.seiza"/>, about a
        fists-width apart. Nage presents both wrists to Uke, who grabs both wrists and pushes them
        toward Nage in an attempt to push him over backward. Nage resists and then raises his arms
        up and toward Uke's head. Nage spreads his hands, cutting upward with one hand and down and
        back with the other, drawing Uke sideways. Nage raises into <term>keiza</term> and draws Uke
        onto his back and pins Uke by the wrist and outside shoulder. Nage maintains a straight back
        and projects his <term keyref="glossary.ki"/> through his arms to maintain the pin.
        Uke attempts to rise and taps when he feels his is completely immobilized.</p>
