  <glossterm>Multi-master AHB</glossterm>
  <glossdef>Typically a shared, not multi-layer, AHB interconnect scheme. More than one master connects to a single AMBA AHB link. In this case, the bus is implemented with a set of full AMBA AHB master interfaces. Masters that use the AMBA AHB-Lite protocol must connect through a wrapper to supply full AMBA AHB master signals to support multi-master operation.</glossdef>
