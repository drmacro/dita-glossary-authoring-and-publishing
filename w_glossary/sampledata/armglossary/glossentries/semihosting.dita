  <glossdef>A mechanism to communicate Input/Output (I/O) requests from application code to a host workstation running a debugger. For example, you can use semihosting to enable functions in the C library, such as printf() and scanf(), to use the screen and keyboard on the host workstation instead of having a screen and keyboard on the target system.</glossdef>
