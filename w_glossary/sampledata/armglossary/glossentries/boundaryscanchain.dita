  <glossterm>boundary scan chain</glossterm>
  <glossdef>A boundary scan chain is made up of serially-connected devices that implement boundary scan technology using a standard JTAG TAP interface. Each device contains at least one TAP controller containing shift registers that form the chain, connected between TDI and TDO, through which test data is shifted. A processor can contain several shift registers, enabling you to access selected parts of the device.</glossdef>
