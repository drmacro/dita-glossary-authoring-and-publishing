  <glossdef>Indicates cases where an attempt to execute a particular encoding bit pattern generates an exception, that is taken to the current Exception level, or to the default Exception level for taking exceptions if the UNDEFINED encoding was executed at EL0. This applies to: &#x201A;&#xC4;&#xA2; Any encoding that is not allocated to any instruction. &#x201A;&#xC4;&#xA2; Any encoding that is defined as never accessible at the current Exception level. &#x201A;&#xC4;&#xA2; Some cases where an enable, disable, or trap control means an encoding is not accessible at the current Exception level. If the generated exception is taken to an Exception level that is using AArch32 then it is taken as an Undefined Instruction exception. Note: On reset, the default Exception level for taking exceptions from EL0 is EL1. However, an implementation might include controls that can change this, effectively making EL1 inactive. See the description of the Exception model for more information When UNDEFINED appears in body text, it is written in small capitals.</glossdef>
