  <glossterm>ATB bridge</glossterm>
  <glossdef>A synchronous ATB bridge provides a register slice that meets timing requirements by adding a pipeline stage. It provides a unidirectional link between two synchronous ATB domains. An asynchronous ATB bridge provides a unidirectional link between two ATB domains with asynchronous clocks. This means it connects components in different clock domains.</glossdef>
