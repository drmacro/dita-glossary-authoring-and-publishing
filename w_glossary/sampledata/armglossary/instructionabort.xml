  <glossterm>Instruction Abort</glossterm>
  <glossdef>An indication to the core of an attempted instruction fetch that is not permitted. The Instruction Abort might be generated by access permission checks performed by the memory system on the core, or might be signaled by the memory system. An exception is taken only if the core attempts to execute the instruction. No exception is taken if the core does not execute an instruction that is attempted to fetch or prefetch from a faulting memory location. The AArch64 architecture definitions introduce the term Instruction Abort. Descriptions of AArch32 state use the term Prefetch Abort.</glossdef>
