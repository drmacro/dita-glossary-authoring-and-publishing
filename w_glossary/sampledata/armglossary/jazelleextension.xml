  <glossdef>Some ARM processors before ARMv8 included the Jazelle Extension, to provide hardware execution of some Java bytecodes in AArch32 state, as part of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) implementation. From ARMv8, the architecture supports only an AArch32 Trivial Jazelle implementation, meaning a JVM must be implemented entirely in software. The Jazelle Extension technology is called Jazelle DBX.</glossdef>
