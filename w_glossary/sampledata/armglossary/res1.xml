  <glossterm>RES1</glossterm>
  <glossdef>A reserved bit or field with Should-Be-One-or-Preserved (SBOP) behavior. Used for fields in register descriptions, and for fields in architecturally-defined data structures that are held in memory, for example in translation table descriptors. Note: res1 is not used in descriptions of instruction encodings. Within the architecture, there are some cases where a register bit or bitfield: * Is res1 in some defined architectural context. * Has different defined behavior in a different architectural context.</glossdef>
