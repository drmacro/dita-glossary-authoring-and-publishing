  <glossterm>half-rate clocking</glossterm>
  <glossdef>In an ARM trace macrocell, dividing the trace clock by two so that the TPA can sample trace data signals on both the rising and falling edges of the trace clock. The primary purpose of half-rate clocking is to reduce the signal transition rate on the trace clock of an ASIC for very high-speed systems.</glossdef>
