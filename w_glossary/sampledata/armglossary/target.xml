  <glossdef>In the context of an Arm debugger, the part of your development platform to which you connect the debugger, and on which debugging operations can be performed. A target can be: *A runnable target, such as a core that implements the Arm architecture. When connected to a runnable target, you can perform execution-related debugging operations on that target, such as stepping and tracing. *A non-runnable CoreSight component. CoreSight components provide a system-wide solution to real-time debug and trace.</glossdef>
