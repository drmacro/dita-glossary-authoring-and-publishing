  <glossterm>UNPREDICTABLE</glossterm>
  <glossdef>For an Arm processor, unpredictable means the behavior cannot be relied upon. unpredictable behavior must not perform any function that cannot be performed at the current or a lower level of privilege using instructions that are not unpredictable. unpredictable behavior must not be documented or promoted as having a defined effect.An instruction that is unpredictable can be implemented as undefined. In an implementation that supports Virtualization, the Non-secure execution of unpredictable instructions at a lower level of privilege can be trapped to the hypervisor, provided that at least one instruction that is not unpredictable can be trapped to the hypervisor if executed at that lower level of privilege. For an Arm trace macrocell, unpredictable means that the behavior of the macrocell cannot be relied on. Such conditions have not been validated. When applied to the programming of an event resource, only the output of that event resource is unpredictable. unpredictable behavior can affect the behavior of the entire system, because the trace macrocell can cause the core to enter debug state, and external outputs can be used for other purposes. When unpredictable appears in body text, it is always in small capitals.</glossdef>
