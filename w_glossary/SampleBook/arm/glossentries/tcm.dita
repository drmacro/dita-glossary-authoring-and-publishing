  <glossterm>TCM</glossterm>
  <glossdef>An area of low latency memory that provides predictable instruction execution or data load timing, for cases where deterministic performance is required. TCMs are suited to holding:critical routines such as for interrupt handlingscratchpad datadata types whose locality is not suited to cachingcritical data structures, such as interrupt stacks.</glossdef>
