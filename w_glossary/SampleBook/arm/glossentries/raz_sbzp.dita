  <glossdef>Read-As-Zero, Should-Be-Zero-or-Preserved on writes. Hardware must implement the field as Read-as-Zero, and must ignore writes to the field. Software can rely on the field reading as all 0s, but must use an SBZP policy to write to the field. This description can apply to a single bit that reads as 0, or to a field that reads as all 0s.</glossdef>
