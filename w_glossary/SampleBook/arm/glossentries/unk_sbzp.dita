  <glossdef>Hardware must implement the field as Read-As-Zero, and must ignore writes to the field.Software must not rely on the field reading as all 0s, and except for writing back to the register it must treat the value as if it is unknown. Software must use an SBZP policy to write to the field.This description can apply to a single bit that should be written as its preserved value or as 0, or to a field that should be written as its preserved value or as all 0s.See Also Read-As-Zero (RAZ), Should-Be-Zero-or-Preserved (SBZP), UNKNOWN.</glossdef>
