  <glossterm>ThumbEE instruction</glossterm>
  <glossdef>One or two halfwords that specify an operation for a core in AArch32 state in T32EE Instruction set state to perform. T32EE is the T32 Execution Environment and the T32EE instruction set is based on the T32 instruction set, with some changes and additions to make it a better target for dynamically generated code, that is, code compiled on the device either shortly before or during execution. Armv8 obsoletes the T32EE instruction set.</glossdef>
