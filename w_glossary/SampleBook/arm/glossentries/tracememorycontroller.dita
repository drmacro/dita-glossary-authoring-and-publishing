  <glossterm>Trace Memory Controller</glossterm>
  <glossdef>Controls the capturing or buffering trace generated by trace sources within a system. The TMC receives trace from an ATB interface and can be configured to perform one of the following: * Route the trace out over an AXI master interface, to allow trace to be captured in system memory or in other peripherals. * Capture the trace in a circular buffer in dedicated SRAM. * Buffer the trace in a First In First Out (FIFO) style, to smooth over peaks in trace bandwidth.</glossdef>
