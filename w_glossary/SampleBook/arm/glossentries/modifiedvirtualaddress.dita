  <glossterm>Modified Virtual Address</glossterm>
  <glossdef>The address produced by the FCSE that is sent to the rest of the memory system to be used in place of the normal virtual address.If the FCSE is absent or disabled, the MVA and the Virtual Address (VA) have the same value. From ARMv6, ARM deprecates any use of the FCSE. The FCSE is optional in the unextended ARMv7 architecture, and obsolete from the introduction of the Multiprocessing Extensions.See Also Fast Context Switch Extension (FCSE).</glossdef>
