  <glossterm>Generic Interrupt Controller</glossterm>
  <glossdef>A Generic Interrupt Controller (GIC) is an exclusive block of IP that performs critical tasks of interrupt management, prioritization and routing. GICs are primarily used for boosting processor efficiency and supporting interrupt virtualization. GICs are implemented based on ARM GIC architecture which has evolved from GICv1 to latest version GICv3/v4. ARM has a number of multi-cluster CPU interrupt controllers that provide a range of interrupt management solutions for all types of ARM Cortex processor systems.</glossdef>
