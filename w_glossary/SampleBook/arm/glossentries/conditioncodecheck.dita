  <glossterm>condition code check</glossterm>
  <glossdef>The process of determining whether a conditional instruction executes normally or is treated as a NOP. For an instruction that includes a condition code field, that field is compared with the condition flags to determine whether the instruction is executed normally. For a T32 instruction in an IT block, the value of the ITSTATE register determines whether the instruction is executed normally.</glossdef>
