  <glossterm>memory coherency</glossterm>
  <glossdef>A memory system is coherent if the value read by a data read or instruction fetch is always the value that was most recently written to that location. Memory coherency is difficult when the memory system includes multiple possible physical locations, such as main memory and at least one of a write buffer or one or more caches. See the appropriate ARM Architecture Reference Manual for a more extensive and more rigorous definition of memory coherency.</glossdef>
