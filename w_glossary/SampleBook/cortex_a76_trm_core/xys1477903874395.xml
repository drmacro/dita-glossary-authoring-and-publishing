			<p class="- topic/p ">The <ph class="- topic/ph "><keyword class="- topic/keyword "><tm class="- topic/tm " tmtype="reg">Cortex</tm></keyword><keyword class="- topic/keyword ">‑A76</keyword></ph> core supports the atomic instructions added in Armv8.1 architecture. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">Atomic instructions to cacheable memory can be performed as either
				near atomics or far atomics, depending on where the cache line containing the data
				resides. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">When an instruction hits in the L1 data cache in a unique state,
				then it is performed as a near atomic in the L1 memory system. If the atomic
				operation misses in the L1 cache, or the line is shared with another core, then the
				atomic is sent as a far atomic on the core CHI interface. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">If the operation misses everywhere within the cluster, and the
				interconnect supports far atomics, then the atomic is passed on to the interconnect
				to perform the operation. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">When the operation hits anywhere inside the cluster, or when an
				interconnect does not support atomics, the L3 memory system performs the atomic
				operation. If the line it is not already there, it allocates the line into the L3
				cache. This depends on whether the <keyword class="- topic/keyword ">DSU</keyword> is configured with an L3 cache. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">Therefore, if software prefers that the atomic is performed as a
				near atomic, precede the atomic instruction with a <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">PLDW</codeph> or <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">PRFM PSTL1KEEP</codeph>
				instruction.</p>
			<p class="- topic/p "><ph class="- topic/ph ">Alternatively, the CPUECTLR can be programmed such that different types of atomic instructions attempt to execute as a near atomic.</ph>One cache fill will be made on an atomic. If the cache line is lost before the atomic operation can be made, it will be sent as a far atomic.</p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">The <ph class="- topic/ph "><keyword class="- topic/keyword "><tm class="- topic/tm " tmtype="reg">Cortex</tm></keyword><keyword class="- topic/keyword ">‑A76</keyword></ph> core supports atomics to device or non-cacheable memory, however this relies on
				the interconnect also supporting atomics. If such an atomic instruction is executed
				when the interconnect does not support them, it will result in an abort.</p>

			<title class="- topic/title ">Transient memory region</title>
			<p class="- topic/p ">The core has a specific behavior for memory regions that are marked as
				write-back cacheable and transient, as defined in the Armv8.0 architecture. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">For any load or store that is targeted at a memory region that is
				marked as transient, the following occurs:</p>
			<ul class="- topic/ul ">
				<li class="- topic/li ">If the memory access misses in the L1 data cache, the returned
					cache line is allocated in the L1 data cache but is marked as transient.</li>
				<li class="- topic/li ">When the line is evicted from the L1 data cache, the transient
					hint is passed to the L2 cache so that the replacement policy will not attempt
					to retain the line. When the line is subsequently evicted from the L2 cache, it
					will bypass the next level cache entirely.</li>

			<title class="- topic/title ">Non-temporal loads</title>
			<p class="- topic/p ">Non-temporal loads indicate to the caches that the data is likely to
				be used for only short periods. For example, when streaming single-use read data
				that is then discarded. In addition to non-temporal loads, there are also
				prefetch-memory (<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">PRFM</codeph>) hint instructions with the
					<codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">STRM</codeph> qualifier.</p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">Non-temporal loads to memory which are designated as Write-Back are
				treated the same as loads to Transient memory.</p>
