      <p class="- topic/p ">There is a small dynamic power overhead from the logic that is required to
        wake up the core from WFI low-power state. Other than this, the power that is drawn is
        reduced to static leakage current only.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">When the core executes the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">WFI</codeph>
        instruction, the core waits for all instructions in the core to retire before it enters
        low-power state. The <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">WFI</codeph> instruction ensures that all
        explicit memory accesses that occurred before the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">WFI</codeph>
        instruction in program order have retired.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">In addition, the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">WFI</codeph> instruction ensures
        that store instructions have updated the cache or have been issued to the L3 memory
        system.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">While the core is in WFI low-power state, the clocks in the core are
        temporarily enabled without causing the core to exit WFI low-power state when any of the
        following events are detected:</p>
      <ul class="- topic/ul ">
        <li class="- topic/li ">An L3 snoop request that must be serviced by the core data caches.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">A cache or TLB maintenance operation that must be serviced by the core
          L1 instruction cache, data cache, TLB, or L2 cache.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">An APB access to the debug or trace registers residing in the core power
          domain.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">A GIC CPU access through the AXI4 stream channel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Exit from WFI low-power state occurs when one of the following occurs:</p>
      <ul class="- topic/ul ">
        <li class="- topic/li ">The core detects one of the WFI wake-up events.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">The core detects a reset.</li>
