			<p class="- topic/p ">It allows contents of the core L1 data cache that was present before the reset
				to be observable after the reset. The contents of the L1 cache are retained and are
				not altered on the transition back to the On mode.</p>
				
			<p class="- topic/p ">By default, the core invalidates its caches when power-on reset (<keyword class="- topic/keyword " otherprops="g.signal.name">nCPUPORESET</keyword>) is deasserted.
				If the P-Channel is initialized to the debug recovery mode, and the core is cycled
				through power-on reset along with the system power-on reset, then the cache
				invalidation is disabled. The cache contents are preserved when the core is
				transitioned to the On mode. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">Debug recovery mode also supports preserving RAS state, in addition to the
				cache contents. In this case, a transition to the debug recovery mode is made from
				any of the current states. Once in debug recovery mode, the core is cycled through a
				warm reset with the system warm reset. The RAS and cache state are preserved when
				the core is transitioned to the On mode. </p>
			<p class="- topic/p ">This mode is strictly for debug purposes. It must not be used for
				functional purposes, as correct operation of the L1 cache is not guaranteed when
				entering this mode.</p>
			<note class="- topic/note ">This mode can occur at any time with no guarantee of the state of
				the core. A P-Channel request of this type is accepted immediately, therefore its
				effects on the core, cluster, or the wider system are <term class="- topic/term " outputclass="archterm">unpredictable</term>, and a wider
				system reset might be required. In particular, if there were outstanding memory
				system transactions at the time of the reset, then these may complete after the
				reset when the core is not expecting them and cause a system deadlock.</note>
