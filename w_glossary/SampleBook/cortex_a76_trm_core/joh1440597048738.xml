  <shortdesc class="- topic/shortdesc ">WFE is a feature of the <ph class="- topic/ph "><keyword class="- topic/keyword "><tm class="- topic/tm " tmtype="reg">Arm</tm>v8â€‘A</keyword></ph> architecture. It uses a
    locking mechanism based on events, to put the core in a low-power state by disabling most of the
    clocks in the core, while keeping the core powered up.</shortdesc>

      <p class="- topic/p ">There is a small dynamic power overhead from the logic that is required to
        wake up the core from WFE low-power state. Other than this, the power that is drawn is
        reduced to static leakage current only.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">A core enters into WFE low-power state by executing the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">WFE</codeph> instruction. When the <codeph class="+ topic/ph pr-d/codeph ">WFE</codeph>
        instruction executes, the core waits for all instructions in the core to complete before it
        enters the idle or low-power state.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">If the event register is set, execution of WFE does not cause entry into
        standby state, but clears the event register.</p>
      <p class="- topic/p ">While the core is in WFE low-power state, the clocks in the core are
        temporarily enabled without causing the core to exit WFE low-power state when any of the
        following events are detected:</p>
      <ul class="- topic/ul ">
        
        <li class="- topic/li ">An external snoop request that must be serviced by the core data caches.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">A cache or TLB maintenance operation that must be serviced by the core
          L1 instruction cache, data cache, TLB, or L2 cache.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">An APB access to the debug or trace registers residing in the core power
          domain.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">A GIC CPU access through the AXI4 stream channel.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="- topic/p ">Exit from WFE low-power state occurs when one of the following occurs:</p>
      <ul class="- topic/ul ">
        <li class="- topic/li ">The core detects one of the WFE wake-up events.</li>
        <li class="- topic/li ">The <keyword class="- topic/keyword " otherprops="g.signal.name">EVENTI</keyword> input signal is asserted.</li>
