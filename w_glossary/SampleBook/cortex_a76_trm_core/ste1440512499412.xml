			register. These two registers are referred to as a <term class="- topic/term ">Breakpoint
				Register Pair</term> (BRP). </p>
		<p class="- topic/p ">Four of the breakpoints (BRP 0-3) match only to virtual address and the other
			two (BRP 4 and 5) match against either virtual address or context ID, or VMID. All the
			watchpoints can be linked to two breakpoints (BRP 4 and 5) to enable a memory request to
			be trapped in a given process context.</p>
