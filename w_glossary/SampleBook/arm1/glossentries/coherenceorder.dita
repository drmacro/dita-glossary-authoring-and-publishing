  <glossdef>Data accesses from a set of observers to a byte in memory are coherent if accesses to that byte by the members of the set of observers are consistent with there being a single total order of all writes to that byte in memory by all members of the set of observers. This single total order of all writes to that byte is the coherence order for that byte.</glossdef>
